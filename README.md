My name is Ziare Suddith. I'm a computer science student and in my junior year. I transferred to New Paltz from Dutchess Community College in Poughkeepsie. I'd say I'm liking my stay so far. I spend most of my time writing and editing videos that promote my art and writing career.

My computer experience is centered around Java and some Python. I've taken CPS3 and Discrete and Continuous Algorithms to name a few of my classes. Most of the programs I've written have been for my classes (Line counter, linked stack, a program to view an exoplanet directory), however I do have some personal ones I wrote in python like a grading tool for quizzes, a program that creates a histogram for system data, and a few quizzes for my physics course. Funfact - I creates a game in highschool using scratch (https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/267300322/)

My cousin has been asking me for quite a while to help her build an e-commerce or shopify store and I have been putting it off because I've been focusing on other things. Well this class is now one of the things I have to focus on so I hope to walk away from this course knowing how to put together an e-commerce website.

I'm going through a very complicated time in my life especially with things at home. I find comfort in writing and building up my writing career. Focusing on school related things especially when it comes to coding (I recently fell out of love with coding but still try my best) it can be really difficult. All that I ask is that you don't lose faith in me.
